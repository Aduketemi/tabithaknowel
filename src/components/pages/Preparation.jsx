            <p>
              Standardized tests remain a critical component of the college application processâ€”especially for international students. Although some universities have moved to test-optional or test-blind policies, a strong test score can still significantly enhance a student's application and increase their chances of receiving merit-based scholarships and competitive admission offers.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#0e162a]">Test-Optional vs. Test-Blind: Whatâ€™s the Difference?</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Test-Optional</strong> schools allow students to choose whether to submit test scores. Submitting strong scores can strengthen your application, but you wonâ€™t be penalized for not submitting them.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Test-Blind</strong> schools, on the other hand, do not consider test scores at all, even if submitted. In such cases, other aspects of the application (e.g., GPA, essays, extracurriculars) carry more weight.
            </p>
            <p>
              Understanding this difference is important when deciding whether to prepare for and take standardized testsâ€”and we are here to help you make informed decisions.
